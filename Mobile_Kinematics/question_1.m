% There are several possible answers to this so the check
% is based on the stacked wheel equations.

% Wheel 1, the far right wheel
alpha1 =0;
beta1 =0;
ell1 =1/2;


% Wheel 1, the top left wheel
alpha2 = 2*pi/3;
beta2 = 0;
ell2 = 1/2;
      

% Wheel 3, the bottom left wheel
alpha3 = 4*pi/3;
beta3 = 0;
ell3 = 1/2;
